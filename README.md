Strive Blog API

You are in charge of creating a set of WebAPIs for the Strive Blog application.

Here you can find the Frontend already created

In this second "step" the application should enable the creation, editing, deletion, listing of blog posts

Blog posts should contain following information:

{
"\_id": "SERVER GENERATED ID",
"category": "ARTICLE CATEGORY",
"title": "ARTICLE TITLE",
"cover":"ARTICLE COVER (IMAGE LINK)",
"readTime": {
"value": 2,
"unit": "minute"
},
"author": {
"name": "AUTHOR AVATAR NAME",
"avatar":"AUTHOR AVATAR LINK"
},
"content": "HTML",
"createdAt": "NEW DATE"
}

Backend

The backend should include the following routes:

GET /blogPosts => returns the list of blogposts
GET /blogPosts /123 => returns a single blogpost
POST /blogPosts => create a new blogpost
PUT /blogPosts /123 => edit the blogpost with the given id
DELETE /blogPosts /123 => delete the blogpost with the given id

The persistence must be granted via file system (es.: Json file with a list of blog posts inside)

Sidenote: remember to install the cors package with 'npm i cors', to import it and to use it with 'server.use(cors())'

⚠️ Bodies, params and queries must be validated with express-validator middleware

Frontend

Post article from new article form
Fetch & List your articles at home page

Extra Features
GET /authors/:id/blogPosts/ => get all the posts for an author with a given ID
GET /blogPosts?title=whatever => filter the blogposts and extract the only that match the condition (es.: title contains "whatever")
Add search feature to frontend

Authors should have following information:

name
surname
ID (Unique and server generated)
email
date of birth
avatar (e.g. https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=John+Doe)

The backend should include the following routes:

GET /authors => returns the list of authors
GET /authors/123 => returns a single author
POST /authors => create a new author
PUT /authors/123 => edit the author with the given id
DELETE /authors/123 => delete the author with the given id

The persistence must be granted via file system (es.: Json file with a list of authors inside)

Sidenote: remember to install the cors package with 'npm i cors', to import it with the require statement and to use it with 'server.use(cors())'

Extra
POST authors/checkEmail => check if another author has the same email. The parameter should be passed in the body. It should return true or false.

It should not be possible to add a new author (with POST /authors) if another has the same email.
